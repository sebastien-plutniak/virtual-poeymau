# Virtual Poeymaü

The Poeymaü, a prehistoric cave located in the French side of the Pyrenees, was excavated by Georges Laplace and his collaborators from the 1950s to the 1980s.
It is currently re-studied in the framework of the [PAVO project](https://pavo.hypotheses.org) (Ancient Prehistory of the Ossau Valley).
This repository contains the code of the “[Virtual Poeymaü](https://analytics.huma-num.fr/Sebastien.Plutniak/poeymau/)”, a R shiny application enabling to visualise the data from the past excavations that we extracted from the fieldnote archives.
