The Poeymaü, a prehistoric cave located in the western part of the Pyrenees (in Arudy, France), was excavated by Georges Laplace and his collaborators from the 1950s to the 1980s. This cave is currently restudied in the framework of the [PAVO project](https://pavo.hypotheses.org) (Ancient Prehistory of the Ossau Valley). Data about more than 15,000 objects was extracted from Laplace's excavation field notes. 
The “[Virtual Poeymaü](https://analytics.huma-num.fr/Sebastien.Plutniak/poeymau/)” is a R shiny application to explore this data set with interactive 3D plot, longitudinal and transverse sections, and summary statistics.
